# High Street Gym Project

This project is a dynamic website for High Street Gym, which includes class bookings, user authentication, a gym classes calendar, and a members' blog. The project uses MySQL for the database and Prisma as the ORM.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

-  Node.js (v14 or later)
-  npm (v6 or later)
-  MySQL (v8.0 or later)
-  Docker (optional, for containerized environments)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine.

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your database URL:

```env
DATABASE_URL="mysql://username:password@localhost:3306/high-street-gym"
```

### 3. Set Up the MySQL Database

Ensure your MySQL server is running on the right port.

### 4. Run Prisma Migrations

Prisma will use the schema defined in `prisma/schema.prisma` to set up the database tables. This command will also automatically seed the database with initial data if you have a seed file.

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
```

### 5. Generate Prisma Client

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

### 6. Seed the Database (Optional)

If you have a seed file, you can run it to populate your database with initial data.

```bash
node prisma/seed.js
```

### 7. Start the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the application in action.

## Project Structure

-  `/prisma`: Contains Prisma schema and migration files.
-  `/src`: Main source code for the application.
-  `/public`: Static files.

## Scripts

-  `npm run dev`: Starts the development server.
-  `npm run build`: Builds the application for production.
-  `npm run start`: Starts the production server.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

-  **MySQL Connection Errors**: Ensure your MySQL server is running and the connection details in `.env` are correct.
-  **Prisma Migration Issues**: If you encounter issues with migrations, you may need to reset the database by deleting the `migrations` folder in `prisma` and rerunning the migrations.

## Additional Notes

-  Ensure your MySQL server's timezone is set to UTC for consistency.
-  Use Docker for containerized setup to avoid dependency conflicts. Refer to `docker-compose.yml` for a sample Docker configuration.
